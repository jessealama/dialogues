  Use continuations?
* TODO Enter Rahman and Tulenheimo's dialogue rules
  Their rules are not the same as Felscher's.  Rahman and Tulenheimo
  include a rule that restricts repetitions, which is a source of
  problems for Felscher's rules.
* TODO Learn how to make a pre-commit script to check for compiler errors.
  My git commits are often incoherent and lead to ill-formed code
  because some changes are committed piecemeal when they should be
  committed as a unit.

  One idea for a pre-commit script: have a temporary repo into which I
  actually do a commit; do a fresh pull from HEAD of this temporary
  repo into a temporary directory; try compiling everything.  If
  something goes wrong, bail out of the pre-commit script.
