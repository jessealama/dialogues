#+TODO: TODO IN-PROGRESS | DONE CANCELED
* DONE Provide a "rewind" feature when playing dialogue games.
  CLOSED: [2010-02-18 Thu 15:55]
* DONE Provide a breadth-first search procedure for enumerating dialogues.
  CLOSED: [2010-02-12 Fri 15:53]
  Use continuations?
* TODO Enter Rahman and Tulenheimo's dialogue rules
  Their rules are not the same as Felscher's.  Rahman and Tulenheimo
  include a rule that restricts repetitions, which is a source of
  problems for Felscher's rules.
* TODO Learn how to make a pre-commit script to check for compiler errors.
  My git commits are often incoherent and lead to ill-formed code
  because some changes are committed piecemeal when they should be
  committed as a unit.

  One idea for a pre-commit script: have a temporary repo into which I
  actually do a commit; do a fresh pull from HEAD of this temporary
  repo into a temporary directory; try compiling everything.  If
  something goes wrong, bail out of the pre-commit script.
* TODO A more general search procedure
  I'll be doing search in spaces made up of things other than dialogues.
* TODO Implement a tableaux search procedure
  What's a reference? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_tableaux
  
* DONE An ASDF system definition
* DONE Bug: if a number is given when a formula is requested, the program dies
  CLOSED: [2010-05-22 Sat 16:21]
* DONE Show the signature being used
  CLOSED: [2010-05-22 Sat 19:14]
* DONE Permit editing of the signature
  CLOSED: [2010-05-22 Sat 19:14]
  At least before the game has begun.
* DONE Permit deleting entries from the signature
  CLOSED: [2010-05-23 Sun 21:22]
* DONE Document the accepted syntax for inputting formulas.
  CLOSED: [2010-05-24 Mon 01:32]
  It's lispy.
* DONE Provide a way to list all available moves.
  CLOSED: [2010-05-25 Tue 20:00]
* DONE Provide a way of quitting the game.
  CLOSED: [2010-05-25 Tue 20:19]
* DONE Provide a way of rewinding the game to a previous spot.
  CLOSED: [2010-05-25 Tue 20:32]
* DONE Provide for symbolic attacks
  CLOSED: [2010-05-25 Tue 20:12]
  Not every assertion in a dialogue game is a logical formula.

  (This is a pretty embarassing gap...)
* CANCELED Show when one player wins or loses.
  CLOSED: [2010-05-25 Tue 20:33]
* DONE Following the "Let's play" button does nothing.			:bug:
  CLOSED: [2010-05-23 Sun 21:39]
  Uh, why?
* DONE Initial parenthesis of formulas is missing			:bug:
  CLOSED: [2010-05-24 Mon 03:03]
  Thus, Peirce's formua is printed "IMPLIES (IMPLIES (IMPLIES P Q) P) P".
* DONE Provide some kind method for checking whether the input formula is correct according to the signature
  CLOSED: [2010-05-24 Mon 02:15]
  Currently, the REPL is thrown into the debugger.  But the debug output should go to the web page.
* IN-PROGRESS Make sure that page titles are generated
  Currently, apparently none are generated.  I must be misusing UCW somehow.
** 2010/05/24 A tip from the #ucw channel on irc.freenode.net
   alama:
   how does one normally set tittes dynamically?
   [11:43pm] alama:
   (in ucw, that is)
   [11:55pm] unknown_lamer:
   there is no one way
   [11:55pm] unknown_lamer:
   that would be an app specific thing
   [11:56pm] unknown_lamer:
   I'd probably do a ... title-setting-component-mixin with a title slot
   [11:56pm] unknown_lamer:
   and then have ... (defgeneric component-title (component)) (which returns nil for anything that is not a t-s-c-mixin)
   [11:57pm] unknown_lamer:
   and then have a custom window class that added an :around method to window-component.title to return (or (component-title (window-body self)) (call-next-method))  
* DONE Make sure that signatures are printed in a coherent way.
  CLOSED: [2010-05-25 Tue 20:46]
  I think I need to use PRINT-UNREADABLE-OBJECT.  It would help to improve on errors like this:

  "The given text, (IMPLIES (IMPLIES P Q) P), is not a formula according to the signature #<SIGNATURE {100322B7C1}>"
* DONE Provide a way of going back to the beginning when an error is generated.
  CLOSED: [2010-06-06 Sun 18:42]
  As it stands now, when an error is generated, UCW generates a page
  that provides no way of going back, or restarting.  It would be nice
  if there were at least some kind of way to restart the game.  Even
  better would be a way to go back to the page/continuation state
  where one was immediately before the error was generated.
** 2010/05/25 Discovery
   [[~/sources/clbuild/source/ucw/src/rerl/request-loop-error.lisp]]
* DONE Ensure that entering dupication functions, constants, and predicates is blocked
  CLOSED: [2010-05-25 Tue 21:03]
* DONE When a session expires (or a user quits), unintern any symbols that were created an interned in the dialogues package 
  CLOSED: [2010-06-13 Sun 18:08]
  This can happen when editing the signature.
  
  We might even want to consider restricting the number of symbols
  that can be created during a session.
* DONE "fancy" printing of formulas
  CLOSED: [2010-06-13 Sun 18:06]
  E.g., use the rarr entity to print implications.
* DONE Allow choosing which dialogue rules to use
  CLOSED: [2010-06-06 Sun 19:18]
  
* DONE Ensure that symbols are printed without their package prefix
  CLOSED: [2010-06-06 Sun 19:27]
* DONE Show closed and open attacks in different colors
  CLOSED: [2010-06-22 Tue 12:28]
  Perhaps grey out the closed attacks, and put the open attacks in bold.
* DONE Give a legend indicating how to interpret the colors.
  CLOSED: [2010-06-22 Tue 12:58]
* IN-PROGRESS Provide a way of switching the dialogue rules.
  This is an intermediate step between providing no functionality for
  editing rules, and providing a full-blown rule editor.  The idea is
  that we have three rulesets: D-rules, E-rules, and rules for
  classical logic.  It would be nice to provide a way to switch
  between them.

* DONE A better presentation of rule-violating moves
  CLOSED: [2010-06-26 Sat 22:21]
  At present (2010-06-26), the problem report simply shows the game so
  far, and describes the problematic move in a format entirely
  different from the other moves of the game.  A better way to present
  the problematic move would be to display it like the
  already-existing rules, but flagged somehow.

  We could use a different tabe section (TBODY) to display the
  problematic move and then show the rules that are violated.
* DONE Provide a way of applying the GÃ¶del-Gentzen translation to a "famous formula"
  CLOSED: [2010-06-26 Sat 21:33]
  There would then be three ways to enter formulas:
  - manually,
  - from a pulldown list,
  - from a pulldown list of formulas together with a pulldown list of
    translations
* TODO Provide a way to enter TeX code for formulas
* TODO Allow entering greek formulas in the signature
  phi, psi, theta, chi, etc.
* DONE Allow interactive play: computer as Opponent (or as Proponent).
  CLOSED: [2010-06-29 Tue 23:27]
  Low-hanging fruit: just choose randomly when multiple choices are
  available.
* TODO Playing online with other human players.
* TODO Define a function for checking for fixed-points.
  What's the definition, and how to I implement it?
* DONE Define a variant of EVAL-ENTIRE-DIALOGUE that simply returns NIL on failure
  CLOSED: [2010-08-25 Wed 00:46]
  We need a variant that terminates with failure as quickly as
  possible.  Currently, EVAL-ENTIRE-DIALOGUE not only signals success
  or failure, but gathers all the rules that are violated.  In some
  contexts, we don't care what rules are violated; if even one is
  violated, we need to stop immediately.

  This could boost performance significantly.
* DONE Design a bounded breadth-first search algorithm that indicates whether it failed due to the depth cutoff 
  CLOSED: [2010-08-24 Tue 15:00]
  The moment we find a node whose depth exceeds the limit, terminate the search and say that the depth limit is exceeded.
* DONE If a winning play is found, permit looking for another one.
  CLOSED: [2010-08-25 Wed 02:02]
  There's generally more than one winning play.
  
  The same goes for strategies.  (Though finding multiple winning
  strategies will require more work.)

  Continuations would be a nice way to do this.
* TODO Sara's style suggestions
** TODO There is too much text, on both the front page and the internal
pages.
** TODO A navigational sidebar (and also maybe a pretty heading banner?)
would be nice.
   The sidebar would include the following links:
   - "Play a game"
   - "Search for a winning play"
   - "Search for a winning strategy"
   - "About dialogical logic"
   - "About the website"
   - a link to the blog? (if not linked from the "about dl" page)
   - a contact link
** TODO Not entirely sure what should then go onto the main front page;
    I would start with nothing for the time being.
** TODO For the "play the game" page
*** TODO remove "about Lorenzen dialogue games"
    since that goes into the "about dl" page.
*** DONE Change "The signature that will be used" to just "Signature"
    CLOSED: [2010-10-12 Tue 16:20]
*** CANCELED Link "Signature" to a pop-up window that allows you to edit the sig.
    CLOSED: [2010-10-14 Thu 11:14]
*** DONE Change "Enter a formula or choose a famous formula from the menu" to "Formula"
    CLOSED: [2010-10-12 Tue 16:21]
*** DONE Have just the drop-down menu, with one option being "enter a formula manually", which goes to another pop-up window.
    CLOSED: [2010-10-12 Tue 17:01]
    Not entirely sure yet where the table of famous formula names
    should go, or the info about LISP notation.  The latter can
    probably just remain on "play the game" page.
*** DONE Change "Select a translation to be applied to the selected formula:" to "Translation"
    CLOSED: [2010-10-12 Tue 16:21]
*** TODO Link the word "Translation" to a pop-up window w/ the info currently at the bottom of the page.
**** TODO Ditto for rules & play style.
* DONE Display strategies
  CLOSED: [2010-08-25 Wed 18:36]
* TODO Spawn threads for search procedures
  The server can spin out of control if its given a search task that
  takes too long.  It seems that the only thing I can do when this
  happens is kill and restart the whole lisp process, which sucks.
  Unacceptable, really.

  The idea would be that threads could be used throttle resources,
  specifically time.  We could implement a hard time cutoff, say, 60
  seconds.  We could then proceed a couple of ways.  We could just
  terminate the search and say "sorry" to the user.  Or we could
  generate an intermediate page, saying that the search is going on a
  long time -- would you like to continue, tune the parameters of the
  search, or quit?  If the user chooses to continue, we could then
  give them another 60 seconds.  And so forth.

* TODO List the ruleset in force when displaying winning strategies
  Show it also when the search for a winning strategy fails.
* TODO Use 26 letters instead of just 4
* DONE Restore the rewind button
  CLOSED: [2010-10-24 Sun 10:56]
* TODO Name (if any) and translation of the original formula displayed in the "Game so far" table
* TODO Make "dialogical logic" appear somewhere in the page
  For search enging harvesting.
