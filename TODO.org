#+TODO: TODO IN-PROGRESS | DONE CANCELED
* DONE Provide a "rewind" feature when playing dialogue games.
  CLOSED: [2010-02-18 Thu 15:55]
* DONE Provide a breadth-first search procedure for enumerating dialogues.
  CLOSED: [2010-02-12 Fri 15:53]
  Use continuations?
* TODO Enter Rahman and Tulenheimo's dialogue rules
  Their rules are not the same as Felscher's.  Rahman and Tulenheimo
  include a rule that restricts repetitions, which is a source of
  problems for Felscher's rules.
* TODO Learn how to make a pre-commit script to check for compiler errors.
  My git commits are often incoherent and lead to ill-formed code
  because some changes are committed piecemeal when they should be
  committed as a unit.

  One idea for a pre-commit script: have a temporary repo into which I
  actually do a commit; do a fresh pull from HEAD of this temporary
  repo into a temporary directory; try compiling everything.  If
  something goes wrong, bail out of the pre-commit script.
* TODO A more general search procedure
  I'll be doing search in spaces made up of things other than dialogues.
* TODO Implement a tableaux search procedure
  What's a reference? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_tableaux
  
* DONE An ASDF system definition
* DONE Bug: if a number is given when a formula is requested, the program dies
