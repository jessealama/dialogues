#+TODO: TODO IN-PROGRESS | DONE CANCELED
* DONE Provide a "rewind" feature when playing dialogue games.
  CLOSED: [2010-02-18 Thu 15:55]
* DONE Provide a breadth-first search procedure for enumerating dialogues.
  CLOSED: [2010-02-12 Fri 15:53]
  Use continuations?
* TODO Enter Rahman and Tulenheimo's dialogue rules
  Their rules are not the same as Felscher's.  Rahman and Tulenheimo
  include a rule that restricts repetitions, which is a source of
  problems for Felscher's rules.
* TODO Learn how to make a pre-commit script to check for compiler errors.
  My git commits are often incoherent and lead to ill-formed code
  because some changes are committed piecemeal when they should be
  committed as a unit.

  One idea for a pre-commit script: have a temporary repo into which I
  actually do a commit; do a fresh pull from HEAD of this temporary
  repo into a temporary directory; try compiling everything.  If
  something goes wrong, bail out of the pre-commit script.
* TODO A more general search procedure
  I'll be doing search in spaces made up of things other than dialogues.
* TODO Implement a tableaux search procedure
  What's a reference? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_tableaux
  
* DONE An ASDF system definition
* DONE Bug: if a number is given when a formula is requested, the program dies
  CLOSED: [2010-05-22 Sat 16:21]
* DONE Show the signature being used
  CLOSED: [2010-05-22 Sat 19:14]
* DONE Permit editing of the signature
  CLOSED: [2010-05-22 Sat 19:14]
  At least before the game has begun.
* DONE Permit deleting entries from the signature
  CLOSED: [2010-05-23 Sun 21:22]
* DONE Document the accepted syntax for inputting formulas.
  CLOSED: [2010-05-24 Mon 01:32]
  It's lispy.
* DONE Provide a way to list all available moves.
  CLOSED: [2010-05-25 Tue 20:00]
* DONE Provide a way of quitting the game.
  CLOSED: [2010-05-25 Tue 20:19]
* DONE Provide a way of rewinding the game to a previous spot.
  CLOSED: [2010-05-25 Tue 20:32]
* DONE Provide for symbolic attacks
  CLOSED: [2010-05-25 Tue 20:12]
  Not every assertion in a dialogue game is a logical formula.

  (This is a pretty embarassing gap...)
* CANCELED Show when one player wins or loses.
  CLOSED: [2010-05-25 Tue 20:33]
* DONE Following the "Let's play" button does nothing.			:bug:
  CLOSED: [2010-05-23 Sun 21:39]
  Uh, why?
* DONE Initial parenthesis of formulas is missing			:bug:
  CLOSED: [2010-05-24 Mon 03:03]
  Thus, Peirce's formua is printed "IMPLIES (IMPLIES (IMPLIES P Q) P) P".
* DONE Provide some kind method for checking whether the input formula is correct according to the signature
  CLOSED: [2010-05-24 Mon 02:15]
  Currently, the REPL is thrown into the debugger.  But the debug output should go to the web page.
* IN-PROGRESS Make sure that page titles are generated
  Currently, apparently none are generated.  I must be misusing UCW somehow.
** 2010/05/24 A tip from the #ucw channel on irc.freenode.net
   alama:
   how does one normally set tittes dynamically?
   [11:43pm] alama:
   (in ucw, that is)
   [11:55pm] unknown_lamer:
   there is no one way
   [11:55pm] unknown_lamer:
   that would be an app specific thing
   [11:56pm] unknown_lamer:
   I'd probably do a ... title-setting-component-mixin with a title slot
   [11:56pm] unknown_lamer:
   and then have ... (defgeneric component-title (component)) (which returns nil for anything that is not a t-s-c-mixin)
   [11:57pm] unknown_lamer:
   and then have a custom window class that added an :around method to window-component.title to return (or (component-title (window-body self)) (call-next-method))  
* DONE Make sure that signatures are printed in a coherent way.
  CLOSED: [2010-05-25 Tue 20:46]
  I think I need to use PRINT-UNREADABLE-OBJECT.  It would help to improve on errors like this:

  "The given text, (IMPLIES (IMPLIES P Q) P), is not a formula according to the signature #<SIGNATURE {100322B7C1}>"
* TODO Provide a way of going back to the beginning when an error is generated.
  As it stands now, when an error is generated, UCW generates a page
  that provides no way of going back, or restarting.  It would be nice
  if there were at least some kind of way to restart the game.  Even
  better would be a way to go back to the page/continuation state
  where one was immediately before the error was generated.
** 2010/05/25 Discovery
   [[~/sources/clbuild/source/ucw/src/rerl/request-loop-error.lisp]]
* DONE Ensure that entering dupication functions, constants, and predicates is blocked
